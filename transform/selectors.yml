selectors:
  - name: prep
    description: |
      Data preparation and cleaning. Very early stages of data transformation
      that does not involve any longitudinal information or imputation. Includes:

      * Data reshaping
      * Aggregation to 5-minute buckets
      * Aligning timestamps and filling timestamp gaps
      * Diagnostic heuristics

      In particular, this group does not have any `asof` joins, which involve joins
      across un-aligned time series, which makes them fairly easy to run incrementally
      and backfill as-needed.

    description: |
      Imputation-related data models.

      Data quality issues in the raw data can result in gaps and unreliable data.
      The data transformations in this selector are all related to *imputation*,
      where we fill those gaps or unreliable data points. In general, this process
      involves looking at historical data, and joining along un-aligned time series.
      For that reason, it's important that the data in the `prep` group be fully
      backfilled before running this selector.

    description: |
      Performance metrics and data marts.

      Most of these are computed based on the imputed data models,
      rather than raw data models.
