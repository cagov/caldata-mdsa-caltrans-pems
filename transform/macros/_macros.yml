      Full refreshes of incremental models sometimes need a little bit of
      extra firepower. This returns an appropriate (i.e. 4XL) warehouse
      for that case. Use it with caution! This returns large if either of
      the following conditions are met:

      * The target table doesn't exist (i.e., hasn't been built yet)
      * the `--full-refresh` flag is set via the CLI.
