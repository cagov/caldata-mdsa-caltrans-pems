    description: |
      Full refreshes of incremental models sometimes need a little bit of
      extra firepower. This returns an appropriate (i.e. 4XL) warehouse
      for that case. Use it with caution! This returns large if either of
      the following conditions are met:

      * The target table doesn't exist (i.e., hasn't been built yet)
      * the `--full-refresh` flag is set via the CLI.
  - name: make_model_incremental
    description: |
      This allows for the implementation of complex incremental model
      logic in one line and one place. Check out dbt's docs on incremental
      models: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models-overview.
      In addition to incrementality, it implements the variable
      "dev_model_look_back", which limits the amount of data selected in dev.
      Two things to note: 1) Users implement there own date column; and
      2) This macros does not include a "where" keyword, but does include
      "and". Users are expected to use a "where" clause when implementing this.
