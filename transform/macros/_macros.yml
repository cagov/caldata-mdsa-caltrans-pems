      Full refreshes of incremental models sometimes need a little bit of
      extra firepower. This returns an appropriate (i.e. 4XL) warehouse
      for that case. Use it with caution! This returns large if either of
      the following conditions are met:

      * The target table doesn't exist (i.e., hasn't been built yet)
      * the `--full-refresh` flag is set via the CLI.

      This allows for the implementation of complex incremental model
      logic in one line and one place. It checks for the incremental model
      configuration at the top of the file then implements a conditional
      check of the target environement. Check out dbt's docs on incremental
      models: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models-overview.
