macros:
  - name: get_snowflake_refresh_warehouse
    description: |
      Full refreshes of incremental models sometimes need a little bit of
      extra firepower. This returns an appropriate (i.e. 4XL) warehouse
      for that case. Use it with caution! This returns large if either of
      the following conditions are met:

      * The target table doesn't exist (i.e., hasn't been built yet)
      * the `--full-refresh` flag is set via the CLI.
  - name: make_model_incremental
    description: |
      This allows for the implementation of complex incremental model
      logic in one line and one place. Check out [dbt's docs on incremental
      models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models-overview).

      In addition to incrementality, it implements the variable
      "dev_model_look_back", which limits the amount of data selected in dev.
      Two things to note:
        1. Users implement their own date column
        2. This macros does not include a "where" keyword, but does include
        "and". Users are expected to use a "where" clause when implementing this.

  - name: make_model_duplicate_proof
    description: |
      This allows for the idempotent upper stream data relay that introduces duplicates
      with attempts to fix missing data. By specify the primary keys, this macro will 
      perform operations to ensure the output will honor the specified primary key constraints. 
      Four columns as primary key are more than enough according to current design. 
      
      When there are less than four primary keys, pad to four primary keys with existing 
      primary key names.
