      This polygon feature class represents the California county boundaries. Based on TIGER/Line 2010 county
      files, the Caltrans districts and California county name abbreviation were added to this layer for
      Caltrans internal GIS application. [Data

      The District feature class is a polygon coverage representing the California Department of Transportation
      (Caltrans) district boundaries. There are 12 Caltrans Districts in California. Caltrans also has Regions
      as higher level management areas. The names of Caltrans Regions are included in the layer attribute table.

      The District boundary definitions are primarily based on the California county boundaries. The Board of
      Equalization (BOE) County and City Boundary web service is the authoritative source of County boundaries
      and this was used to digitize the district boundaries based on the data from March 2023. This data is
      solely for informational purposes. District 9 has been operating independent of the Central Region since
      November 1, 2015. Kern County remains the only split county in the state, between Districts 6 and 9
      respectively. The BOE data was also used to create the district boundary layers along the coastline.

      StateHighways are state highways based upon the Caltrans Linear Referencing System. Each record in this
      layer represents a highway segment where the county, route, postmile prefix, and postmile suffix are the
      same. Each segment has a begin and end postmile. This geometry is based upon the extraction from TSN on
      10 October 2022.

      Each segment is coded with the district, county, route, postmile prefix (if any), begin postmile, end
      postmile, and postmile suffix (if any). One additional field - AlignCode - should be understood by the
      user for effective use of this data set (refer to the Entity and Attribute Information section of this
      metadata).

      AlignCode indicates if the state highway segment is on a Right alignment, Left alignment, Right side of
      an independent alignment or Left side of an independent alignment. Where TSN (Transportation System
      Network - the source database) considers most state highways to have just a centerline, the underlying
      LRS (Linear Referencing System) linework that these segments are based upon has a line for each direction.

      On undivided highways the right and left lines are identical. On divided highways the right and left are
      separated, but TSN treats the segment as a single centerline. In the last case where highways are not only
      divided but also have different lengths (where the right and left carriageway diverge around physical
      obstacles or are separated onto different one-way streets) the underlying linework has dual carriageways,
      and TSN treats the segment as an "independent alignment".  In some cases (especially for small-scale
      mapping), it may be appropriate to display linework for just one alignment (e.g. Right alignment), and only
      for the other side where TSN indicates independent right and left alignments. In other cases (e.g.
      large-scale mapping), it may be appropriate to display postmiles for both alignments, regardless of how TSN
      treats the segment.

      The bOdometer and eOdometer fields represent the actual distance in miles from the start of the highway to
      the begin and end of each highway section.  This is in contrast to the begin and end postmile values, which
      no longer represent these values as each highway is realigned (and made longer or shorter) over time. [Data
