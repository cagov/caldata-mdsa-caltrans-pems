          The Travel Time Index (TTI) is the ratio of the average travel time for all users
          across a region to the free-flow travel time across all the lanes.
          The free-flow travel time is taken to be the time to traverse the link when traveling at 60MPH.
          For loop-based performance measures, the TTI is simply the free-flow speed divided by the
          performance measure Q.
