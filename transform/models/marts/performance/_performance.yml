        description: |
          The Travel Time Index (TTI) is the ratio of the average travel time for all users
          across a region to the free-flow travel time. The free-flow travel time is taken
          to be the time to traverse the link when traveling at 60MPH. For loop-based
          performance measures, the TTI is simply the free-flow speed divided by the
          performance measure Q.

          Q is the sum of the VMT in a spatial and temporal region divided by the sum of
          the VHT in the same region in a given day across all the lanes. For a single location
          its interpretation is the
          average speed.
      - name: DELAY
        description: |
          daily delay for different threshold of congestion speed such as 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 mph
           across all the lanes.The Delay performance metric is the amount of additional time spent by the
           vehicles on a section of road due to congestion.
      - name: LOST_PRODUCTIVITY
        description: |
          This is the daily lost productivity that is simply sum up 24 hours
          lost productivity in a given day timeperiod across all the lanes.The lost Productivity
          perfromance metric is the number of lane-mile-days on the freeway lost due to operating under
           congested conditions instead of under free-flow conditions.
  - name: performance__station_metrics_agg_monthly
    description: |
      monthly aggregation of volume,speed, and occupancy along with delays and lost productivity by
      across all lanes of the station. This metrics will measure the daily performance
      of the state highway system. This can be used to understand the SHS performance
      from month to month.
