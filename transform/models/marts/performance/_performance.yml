      - name: AADT_1
        description:
          This is simply the average of all daily traffic flows over the entire year.
          it is known as Arithmetic Mean.
      - name: AADT_2
        description: |
          This procedure begins by calculating Monthly Average Days of the Week (MADW) values,
          which are the average daily flows for each day of the week and each month of the
          year (a total of 84 values). From these, 12 Monthly Average Daily Traffic (MADT)
          values are calculated as the average of the non-missing MADW values for each month.
          Finally, AADT_2 is computed as the average of all MADT values. This algorithm allows
          one or more of the 7 weekday values to be missing for the MADT computation,
          but none of the 12 MADT values may be missing for the final average. This is known as
          ASTM Standard 1442.
      - name: AADT_3
        description: |
          This algorithm also starts with the MADW values, computed as described above for AADT_2.
          From these, an Annual Average Days of the Week (AADW) value is computed for each day of
          the week as the average across all 12 months. Finally, AADT_3 is computed as the average
          of these 7 AADW values.Missing data are not imputed; therefore, incomplete days are not
          used in the calculation of MADW values.This is known as Conventional AASHTO Procedures.
      - name: AADT_4
        description: |
          This procedure first calculates, across all 12 months, the monthly average flow for each
          hour of the week (MAHW), which results in 24 x 7 = 168 values per month. Then for each month
          and day of the week, the 24 MAHW values are summed to produce a MADW value. Then, just as in
          AADT_3, 7 AADW values are produced as the averages of MADW across 12 months, which are then
          averaged to yield AADT_4.This method is known as Provisional AASHTO Procedures.
      - name: AADT_5
        description: |
          For each hour of the day, hourly traffic flow is averaged across all days of the year,
          resulting in 24 annual average hourly values. AADT_5 is computed as the sum of the 24 hourly
          values.This method is known as Sum of 24 Annual Average Hourly Traffic Volumes.
      - name: AADT_6
        description: |
          This procedure is a modified version of AADT_2, in which 1 of the 12 MADT values may be
          missing for the final AADT calculation. This is the Modified ASTM Standard.
      - name: AADT_7
        description: |
          This procedure is a modified version of AADT_3, in which 1 of the 12 MADW values may be
          missing in the AADW subcomputation, and/or 1 of the 7 AADW values may be missing in the
          final AADT_7 computation. This is Modified Conventional AASHTO.
      - name: AADT_8
        description: |
          Similarly, this procedure is a modified version of AADT_4, in which 1 of the 12 MADW
          values may be missing in the AADW subcomputation, and/or 1 of the 7 AADW values may
          be missing in the final AADT_8 computation. This is Modified Provisional AASHTO.
