          yearly delay aggregated by cities for different target speed thresholds across all the lanes.
          The Delay performance metric is the amount of additional time spent by the vehicles on a section
          of road due to congestion.
      - name: LOST_PRODUCTIVITY
        description: |
          This is the yearly lost productivity that is simply sum up 24 hours
          lost productivity in a given year timeperiod across all the lanes. The lost productivity
          performance metric is the number of lane-mile-days on the freeway lost due to operating under
           congested conditions instead of under free-flow conditions.
  - name: performance__station_metrics_unpivot_agg_yearly_county
    description: |
      yearly aggregation of delay and productivity across all lanes aggregated by counties. This metrics will
      measure the yearly delay and lost productivity of the state highway system.
