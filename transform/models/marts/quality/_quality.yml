  - name: quality__row_count_summary
    description: |
      This model counts the number of ML and HV detectors across multiple models on a daily basis
      to ensure that the detector count is consistent between all of the models. The models
      where detector counts are being evaluated are:
      - int_diagnostics__detector_status model
      - int_clearinghouse__detector_agg_five_minutes_with_missing_rows
      - int_imputation__detector_imputed_agg_five_minutes
      - int_performance__detector_metrics_agg_five_minutes
      The daily detector counts for these models should match. As an additional aggregation
      the number of good, bad, and total detectors is calculated in this model as well to monitor
      for any changes that should be investigated. The number of detectors and their health
      should not vary drastically between days so this model can help identify anamolies.

  - name: quality__station_row_count_summary
    description: |
      This model summarizes the daily counts of ML and HV detectors for each
      station across multiple source models to ensure consistency and completeness
      of station-level data. It helps identify discrepancies or missing data at
      the station level by comparing detector counts between models.
      Monitoring these counts can highlight stations with data quality issues or
      anomalies that require further investigation.
