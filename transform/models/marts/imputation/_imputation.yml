  - name: imputation__detector_summary
    description: |
      This model summarize the pentration of imputation by each method.
      It provides the total number of samples for five minutes in station
      level as well as percetage of observed and imputed by each method
      by sample date.
    columns:
      - name: STATION_ID
        description: |
          An integer value that uniquely indentifies a station.
          Use this value to 'join' other files or tables that contain the Station ID value.
