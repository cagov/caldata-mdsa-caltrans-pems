          The District feature class is a polygon coverage representing the California Department of Transportation
          (Caltrans) district boundaries. There are 12 Caltrans Districts in California. Caltrans also has Regions
          as higher level management areas. The names of Caltrans Regions are included in the layer attribute table.

          The District boundary definitions are primarily based on the California county boundaries. The Board of
          Equalization (BOE) County and City Boundary web service is the authoritative source of County boundaries
          and this was used to digitize the district boundaries based on the data from March 2023. This data is
          solely for informational purposes. District 9 has been operating independent of the Central Region since
          November 1, 2015. Kern County remains the only split county in the state, between Districts 6 and 9
          respectively. The BOE data was also used to create the district boundary layers along the coastline.

          StateHighways are state highways based upon the Caltrans Linear Referencing System. Each record in this
          layer represents a highway segment where the county, route, postmile prefix, and postmile suffix are the
          same. Each segment has a begin and end postmile. This geometry is based upon the extraction from TSN on
          10 October 2022.

          Each segment is coded with the district, county, route, postmile prefix (if any), begin postmile, end
          postmile, and postmile suffix (if any). One additional field - AlignCode - should be understood by the
          user for effective use of this data set (refer to the Entity and Attribute Information section of this
          metadata).

          AlignCode indicates if the state highway segment is on a Right alignment, Left alignment, Right side of
          an independent alignment or Left side of an independent alignment. Where TSN (Transportation System
          Network - the source database) considers most state highways to have just a centerline, the underlying
          LRS (Linear Referencing System) linework that these segments are based upon has a line for each direction.

          On undivided highways the right and left lines are identical. On divided highways the right and left are
          separated, but TSN treats the segment as a single centerline. In the last case where highways are not only
          divided but also have different lengths (where the right and left carriageway diverge around physical
          obstacles or are separated onto different one-way streets) the underlying linework has dual carriageways,
          and TSN treats the segment as an "independent alignment".  In some cases (especially for small-scale
          mapping), it may be appropriate to display linework for just one alignment (e.g. Right alignment), and
          only for the other side where TSN indicates independent right and left alignments. In other cases (e.g.
          large-scale mapping), it may be appropriate to display postmiles for both alignments, regardless of how
          TSN treats the segment.

          The bOdometer and eOdometer fields represent the actual distance in miles from the start of the highway
          to the beginning and end of each highway section.  This is in contrast to the begin and end postmile
          values, which no longer represent these values as each highway is realigned (and made longer or shorter)
          over time. [Data
