  - name: int_vds__controller_config
    description: |
      Configuration metadata for VDS controllers. There may be multiple
      stations hooked up to a single controller. For example, the same
      controller might have a station for the mainline as well as a station
      for an onramp.

      This table is a slowly-changing-dimension-2, meaning that it has multiple
      different versions of the metadata for each controller, with `_valid_from`
      and `_valid_to` datetime columns indicating when the version is correct.

      This model is unique at the level of CONTROLLER_ID + _VALID_TO.

  - name: int_vds__station_config
    description: |
      Metadata for a single VDS station. Multiple stations may be connected to
      a single controller, and multiple detectors may be connected to a single station.

      This table is a slowly-changing-dimension-2, meaning that it has multiple
      different versions of the metadata for each controller, with `_valid_from`

  - name: int_vds__detector_config
    description: |
      Metadata for a single loop detector. This is the device that actually records
      flow, occupancy, and speed, and is typically installed in a single lane.
      Multiple detectors across a set of lanes constitute a station.

      Unlike the equivalent configuration models for controller and station,
      this metadata model is further joined with metadata for each detector's
      station. This adds some further denormalization to the table, but is a
      practical response to so many downstream metrics relying on station metadata.

      This table is a slowly-changing-dimension-2, meaning that it has multiple
      different versions of the metadata for each controller, with `_valid_from`
      and `_valid_to` datetime columns indicating when the version is correct.

  - name: int_vds__nearby_stations
    description: |
      The model employs postmile-based distance metrics to identify nearby stations, specifically
      focusing on HOV and Mainline stations. This approach calculates distances between a target
      station and its upstream and downstream counterparts, using these distances to pinpoint
      secondary stations for data imputation purposes. For local regression, it utilizes the nearest
      upstream and downstream stations, while regional regression incorporates all stations within
      a 5-mile radius. This dual regression strategy aims to predict or analyze station-related data,
      leveraging both spatial proximity and statistical techniques to enhance understanding and
      planning within transportation contexts.

      This model is unique at the level of DETECTOR_ID + OTHER_STATION_ID +_VALID_TO.

      - name: DELTA_POSTMILE
        description: |
          The difference in absolute postmile between the two stations. A positive
          delta_postmile indicates that `other_id` is downstream (greater postmile)
          from id.

          targetted station to upstream and downstream stations in purpose of identifying local,
          and regional stations for imputation.

  - name: int_vds__active_stations
    description: |

      given day.

  - name: int_vds__active_detectors
    description: |
      Contains detector metadata for all detectors that were designated active on any
      given day.

  - name: int_vds__detector_agg_five_minutes_normalized
    description: |
      This model takes the `int_clearinghouse__detector_agg_five_minutes` model and does some
      data normalization and cleanup.  The following operations are performed
        1. If fewer than ten volume samples are recorded (i.e., if some 30-second samples are
            missing over the five minute period), the volume is extrapolated to the number it
            might have been if all samples were present.
        1. Fill in "missing" rows. Missing rows are added at the 5-minute timestamp level
            between each detector's min and max sample dates (from the parent model).
            For all resulting rows, metadata is filled in but data values (eg. `volume_sum`,
            `occupancy_avg`, etc) are set to `null`, to be imputed later.

      Column descriptions can be found in `int_clearinghouse__detector_agg_five_minutes`.
      This model is unique at the level of SAMPLE_TIMESTAMP + DETECTOR_ID.

    columns:

        description: |
          The observed volume. This will be the same as `volume_sum`, unless extrapolation
          occurs due to fewer than ten samples being present.
