  - name: int_vds__controller_config
    description: |
      Configuration metadata for VDS controllers. There may be multiple
      stations hooked up to a single controller. For example, the same
      controller might have a station for the mainline as well as a station
      for an onramp.

      This table is a slowly-changing-dimension-2, meaning that it has multiple
      different versions of the metadata for each controller, with `_valid_from`
      and `_valid_to` datetime columns indicating when the version is correct.

      This model is unique at the level of CONTROLLER_ID + _VALID_TO.

  - name: int_vds__nearby_stations
    description: |
      The model employs postmile-based distance metrics to identify nearby stations, specifically
      focusing on HOV and Mainline stations. This approach calculates distances between a target
      station and its upstream and downstream counterparts, using these distances to pinpoint
      secondary stations for data imputation purposes. For local regression, it utilizes the nearest
      upstream and downstream stations, while regional regression incorporates all stations within
      a 5-mile radius. This dual regression strategy aims to predict or analyze station-related data,
      leveraging both spatial proximity and statistical techniques to enhance understanding and
      planning within transportation contexts.

      This model is unique at the level of DETECTOR_ID + OTHER_STATION_ID +_VALID_TO.
