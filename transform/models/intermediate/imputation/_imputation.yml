  - name: int_imputation__local_regional_regression_coefficients
    description: |
      Linear regression slopes and intercepts for pairs of detectors.
      They are evaluated at regular dates (`regression_date`) in order to
      make multiple measurements of the coefficients. This allows the values
      to vary with time, and for there to be backup measurements if one detector
      or the other are not operational for the regression dates.
      This model only evaluates new values on the 3rd day of Feb, May, Aug, and Nov.
      This model is unique at the level of REGRESSION_DATE + DETECTOR_ID + OTHER_DETECTOR_ID.
    columns:
      - name: DETECTOR_ID

        description: The district of the dependent detector.
      - name: REGRESSION_DATE
        description: |
          The starting date for the regression. The regressions are evaluated
          over several days, but things like joins with slowly-changing-dimensions
          (i.e., `_valid_from`) are based on the start date.

        description: |
          tagging wheather the other id is local counters
          or regional counters. If the other id is just upstream or downstream
          then it is considered as local counters. On the other hand
          except local counters if any counters are located within 5 miles
          upstream and downstream, then it is considered as regional id.
          This boolean function where True means local counters and false means
          regional counters.
  - name: int_imputation__detector_agg_five_minutes
    description: |
      This model presents the imputed values (speed, volume and occupancy)
      from all three (local, regional and global) imputation methods. We impute
      only for bad detectors while observed value is reported for the good
      detectors. This model should be unique at the level of
      SAMPLE_TIMESTAMP + DETECTOR_ID.

  - name: int_imputation__detector_agg_five_minutes_with_g_factor_speed
    description: |
      This model calculates the g-factor based smoothing speed. According to the PeMS documentation, the
      PeMS system computes speed for sensors that don't report speed, like single loop detectors. The g-factor
      is a value that represents the effective length of the vehicles. Typically, a constant value for the g-factor
      is used which leads to inaccurate speeds because the g-factor varies by lane, time-of-day, as well as the loop
      sensitivity. PeMS estimates a g-factor for each loop for every 5 minutes over an average week to provide accurate
      speed estimates.
    columns:

        description: |
          A specific free flow speed based on the type of freeway (meaning the total number of lanes)
          and the particular lane that the detector is. For example, the free-flow speed in lane 2 of
          a 2-lane freeway is different from the free-flow speed in lane 2 of a 5-lane freeway.

      - name: p_factor
        description: An exponential filter with weights that vary as a function of the flow.
      - name: speed_preliminary
        description: |
          An initial speed estimate is passed through the p_factor based exponential filter. When the
          flow at the loop is low the smoothing is quite severe. When the flow is high, there is little
          smoothing. This allows us to quickly adapt to periods of congestion as well as to have stable
          speeds when the data is sparse (like in the middle of the night).
      - name: speed_smoothed
        description: A smoothed version of the estimated speed by passing through the exponential filter.
      - name: imputed_speed
        description: |
          An imputed version of g-factor based speed, adjusted using upper and lower bounds. Boundaries vary
          based on different scenarios for specific lanes.
