  - name: int_imputation__local_regional_regression_coefficients
    description: |
      Linear regression slopes and intercepts for pairs of detectors.
      They are evaluated at regular dates (`regression_date`) in order to
      make multiple measurements of the coefficients. This allows the values
      to vary with time, and for there to be backup measurements if one detector
      or the other are not operational for the regression dates.
    columns:
      - name: id
        description: The ID of the station with the dependent variables
      - name: other_id
        description: The ID of the station with the independent variables
      - name: lane
        description: The lane of the detector with the dependent variables
      - name: other_lane
        description: The lane of the detector with the independent variables
      - name: district
        description: The district of the dependent detector.
      - name: regression_date
        description: |
          The starting date for the regression. The regressions are evaluated
          over several days, but things like joins with slowly-changing-dimensions
          (i.e., `_valid_from`) are based on the start date.
      - name: speed_slope
        description: The slope of the speed regression
      - name: speed_intercept
        description: The intercept of the speed regression
      - name: volume_slope
        description: The slope of the volume regression
      - name: volume_intercept
        description: The intercept of the volume regression
      - name: occupancy_slope
        description: The slope of the occupancy regression
      - name: occupancy_intercept
        description: The intercept of the occupancy regression
      - name: OTHER_STATION_IS_LOCAL
        description: |
          tagging wheather the other id is local counters
          or regional counters. If the other id is just upstream or downstream
          then it is considered as local counters. On the other hand
          except local counters if any counters are located within 5 miles
          upstream and downstream, then it is considered as regional id.
          This boolean function where True means local counters and false means
          regional counters.
  - name: int_imputation__five_minute_aggregation
    description: |
      dfdf
    columns:
      - name: ID
        description: The station ID
      - name: SAMPLE_DATE
        description: The date on which the sample was taken
      - name: SAMPLE_TIMESTAMP
        description: The timestamp of the start for the 5 minute aggregated samples.
      - name: LANE
        description: |
          The lane number of the detector, starting from 1
      - name: VOLUME_SUM
        description: The sum of the flow values for a detector over the sample period.
      - name: OCCUPANCY_AVG
        description: The average of the occupancy values over the sample period.
      - name: SPEED_WEIGHTED
        description: |
          Flow-weighted speed reported by the device.
      - name: volume_local_regression
        description: The volume based on local regressions
      - name: occupancy_local_regression
        description: The occupancy based on local regressions
      - name: speed_local_regression
        description: The speed based on local regressions
      - name: regression_date
        description: |
          The date on which the coefficients in the local regression
          were evaluated.
