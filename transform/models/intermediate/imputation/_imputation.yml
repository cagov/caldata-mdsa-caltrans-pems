  - name: int_imputation__local_regional_regression_coefficients
    description: |
      Linear regression slopes and intercepts for pairs of detectors.
      They are evaluated at regular dates (`regression_date`) in order to
      make multiple measurements of the coefficients. This allows the values
      to vary with time, and for there to be backup measurements if one detector
      or the other are not operational for the regression dates.
      This model only evaluates new values on the 3rd day of Feb, May, Aug, and Nov.
      This model is unique at the level of REGRESSION_DATE + DETECTOR_ID + OTHER_DETECTOR_ID.
    columns:
      - name: DETECTOR_ID
        description: The ID of the detector with the dependent variables.
      - name: OTHER_DETECTOR_ID
        description: The ID of the detector with the independent variables.
      - name: DISTRICT
        description: The district of the dependent detector.
      - name: REGRESSION_DATE
        description: |
          The starting date for the regression. The regressions are evaluated
          over several days, but things like joins with slowly-changing-dimensions
          (i.e., `_valid_from`) are based on the start date.

      - name: OTHER_STATION_IS_LOCAL
        description: |
          tagging wheather the other id is local counters
          or regional counters. If the other id is just upstream or downstream
          then it is considered as local counters. On the other hand
          except local counters if any counters are located within 5 miles
          upstream and downstream, then it is considered as regional id.
          This boolean function where True means local counters and false means
          regional counters.
  - name: int_imputation__detector_agg_five_minutes
    description: |
      This model presents the imputed values (speed, volume and occupancy)
