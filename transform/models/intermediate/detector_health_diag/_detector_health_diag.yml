    description: |
      This SQL file assigns the correct values to appropriate districts and types.
    columns:
      - name: meta_date
        description: Date of the metadata file.
      - name: station_id
        description: |
          An integer value that uniquely indenties the Station Metadata.
          Use this value to 'join' other clearinghouse files that contain Station Metadata.
      - name: district
        description: The district in which the VDS is located. Values are 1-12.

      - name: high_occupancy
        description: |
          The high-occupancy threshold for station diagnostics, above which the
          values are considered suspicious.
      - name: high_flow

  - name: int_pems__diagnostic_samples_per_station
    description: |
      This file contains count data by station and lane based on the number of raw data samples
      that met a variety of flow and occupancy criteria. This data will be used to determine the
      diagnostic value associated with a detector.
    columns:
      - name: sample_date
        description: The date associated with raw data samples being counted.
      - name: station_id
        description: |
          An integer value that uniquely indenties a station.
          Use this value to 'join' other files or tables that contain the Station ID value.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: sample_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume (flow) and occupancy
          values contain any value by station.
      - name: zero_vol_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume (flow) value
          equals 0 by station.
      - name: zero_occ_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's occupancy
          value equals 0 by station.
      - name: zero_vol_pos_occ_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume (flow)
          value equals 0 but occupancy is greater than 0 by station.
      - name: zero_occ_pos_vol_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's occupancy
          value equals 0 but volume (flow) is greater than 0 by station.
      - name: high_volume_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of volume (flow) values in a lane that exceeded the high value threshold
          detector diagnostic parameter for a station.
      - name: high_occupancy_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of occupancy values in a lane that exceeded the high value threshold
          detector diagnostic parameter for a station.
      - name: too_few_samples
        description: |
          Counts the number of samples less than 60% of the max collected samples during the test period.
          The max value is calculated by taking 2 samples per minute and multiplying it times 60 mins/hr
          then multiplying that result by 17 hours in a day which equates to 1224.
          Therefore, between 1 and 1224 is too few samples.
