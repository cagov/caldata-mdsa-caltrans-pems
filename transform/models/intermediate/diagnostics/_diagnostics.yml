          Date a station is considered active based on the meta data configuration file from district.

  - name: int_diagnostics__constant_occupancy
    description: |
      This model calculates constant occupancy by first calculating the delta
      between occupancy and previous occupancy. It then takes the absolute
      value of that delta and sums that over a window of 48 rows which equates
      to 4 hours (5 min data x 12 = 60 (one hour) then 12 x 4 = 48 which is 4
      hours) where occupancy is not null and not zero. Finally it outputs the
      minimum value grouped by id, lane, sample_date.
    columns:
      - name: min_occupancy_delta
        description: |
          Selects the minimum of the abs_val_occupancy_delta_summed column
          which takes the absolute value of the delta between occupancy and
          previous occupancy summed over a window of 4 hours.
