          samples are collected the aggregated (sum) volume rounded to the nearest integer value is used

    description: |
      This model takes the `int_clearinghouse__detector_agg_five_minutes` model and fills in "missing"
      rows. Missing rows are added at the 5-minute timestamp level between each detector's min and max sample
      dates (from the parent model). For all resulting rows, metadata is filled in but data values (eg.
      `volume_sum`, `occupancy_avg`, etc) are set to null, to be imputed later. Column descriptions can be found
      in `int_clearinghouse__detector_agg_five_minutes`.

  - name: int_clearinghouse__detector_g_factor_based_speed
    description: |
      This model calculates the g-factor based smoothing speed. According to the PeMS documentation, the
      PeMS system computes speed for sensors that don't report speed, like single loop detectors. The g-factor
      is a value that represents the effective length of the vehicles. Typically, a constant value for the g-factor
      is used which leads to inaccurate speeds because the g-factor varies by lane, time-of-day, as well as the loop
      sensitivity. PeMS estimates a g-factor for each loop for every 5 minutes over an average week to provide accurate
      speed estimates.
    columns:
      - name: week_start

      - name: free_flow_speed
        description: |
          A specific free flow speed based on the type of freeway (meaning the total number of lanes)
          and the particular lane that the detector is. For example, the free-flow speed in lane 2 of
          a 2-lane freeway is different from the free-flow speed in lane 2 of a 5-lane freeway.
      - name: raw_g_factor

          Smoothed vehicle length calculated using 12 g-factors from the 6 preceding and following 5-minute intervals.
      - name: p_factor
        description: An exponential filter with weights that vary as a function of the flow.
      - name: speed_preliminary
        description: |
          An initial speed estimate is passed through the p_factor based exponential filter. When the
          flow at the loop is low the smoothing is quite severe. When the flow is high, there is little
          smoothing. This allows us to quickly adapt to periods of congestion as well as to have stable
          speeds when the data is sparse (like in the middle of the night).
      - name: speed_smoothed
        description: A smoothed version of the estimated speed by passing through the exponential filter.
      - name: imputed_speed
        description: |
          An imputed version of g-factor based speed, adjusted using upper and lower bounds. Boundaries vary
          based on different scenarios for specific lanes.
