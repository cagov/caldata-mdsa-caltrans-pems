        description: |
          For the 5-minute aggregation there should be 10 30-second samples collected. If 10 or more
          samples are collected the aggregated (sum) volume rounded to the nearest integer value is used
          but if less than 10 samples are recieved in the 5-minute timeframe the flow is normalized using
          the equation: 10 / sample count * sum(volume)
      - name: zero_vol_ct
        description: Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume (flow) value equals 0.
      - name: occupancy_avg
        description: Occupancy of the lane during the sample period expressed as a decimal number between 0 and 1.

      - name: zero_vol_pos_occ_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume
          (flow) value equals 0 but occupancy is greater than 0.
      - name: zero_occ_pos_vol_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's occupancy value
          equals 0 but volume (flow) is greater than 0.
      - name: high_volume_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of volume (flow) values in a lane that exceeded the high
          value threshold detector diagnostic parameter for a station.

  - name: int_clearinghouse__detector_agg_five_minutes_with_missing_rows
    description: |
      This model takes the `int_clearinghouse__detector_agg_five_minutes` model and fills in "missing"
      rows. Missing rows are added at the 5-minute timestamp level between each detector's min and max sample
      dates (from the parent model). For all resulting rows, metadata is filled in but data values (eg.
      `volume_sum`, `occupancy_avg`, etc) are set to null, to be imputed later. Column descriptions can be found
      in `int_clearinghouse__detector_agg_five_minutes`.
    columns:
      - name: detector_id
        description: The unique detector ID.
      - name: SAMPLE_DATE
        description: The date on which the sample was taken.

          group_by_columns: ["detector_id", "sample_date"]
  - name: int_clearinghouse__detector_g_factor_based_speed
    description: |
      This model calculates the g factor based smoothing speed.
    columns:
      - name: threshold

      - name: free_flow_speed
        description: |
          A specific free flow speed based on the type of freeway (meaning the total number of lanes)
          and the particular lane that the detector is. For example, the free-flow speed in lane 2 of
          a 2-lane freeway is different from the free-flow speed in lane 2 of a 5-lane freeway.
      - name: g_factor
        description: |
          Dynamic vehicle length which is an unbiased estimator based on threshold, free_flow_speed
          and real-time occupancy.
      - name: p_factor
        description: An exponential filter with weights that vary as a function of the flow.
      - name: speed_preliminary
        description: |
          An initial speed estimate is passed through the p_factor based exponential filter. When the
          flow at the loop is low the smoothing is quite severe. When the flow is high, there is little
          smoothing. This allows us to quickly adapt to periods of congestion as well as to have stable
          speeds when there is very little data (like in the middle of the night).
      - name: speed_smoothed
        description: A smoothed version of the estimated speed by passing through the exponential filter.
