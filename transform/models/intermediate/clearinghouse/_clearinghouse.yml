      - name: LANE_NUMBER
        description: |

          1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc for each successive lane, rather than counting up
          from one.
      - name: _VALID_FROM
        description: |
          The date that this metadata became valid. Should be the same as `META_DATE`.
          Finding the right metadata for a date should involve a check with

      - name: sample_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume (flow)
          and occupancy values contain any non-null value.

          Lane associated with a route and station from raw data.
      - name: volume_observed
        description: |
          Sum of the 30-second samples actually observed and collected
      - name: volume_normalized
        description: |
          For the 5-minute aggregation there should be 10 30-second samples collected. If 10 or more
          samples are collected the aggregated (sum) volume rounded to the nearest integer value is used
          but if less than 10 samples are recieved in the 5-minute timeframe the flow is normalized using
          the equation: 10 / sample count * sum(volume)
      - name: zero_vol_ct
        description: Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume (flow) value equals 0.
      - name: occupancy_avg
        description: Occupancy of the lane during the sample period expressed as a decimal number between 0 and 1.
      - name: zero_occ_ct
        description: Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's occupancy value equals 0.
      - name: zero_vol_pos_occ_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume
          (flow) value equals 0 but occupancy is greater than 0.
      - name: zero_occ_pos_vol_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's occupancy value
          equals 0 but volume (flow) is greater than 0.
      - name: high_volume_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of volume (flow) values in a lane that exceeded the high
          value threshold detector diagnostic parameter for a station.
      - name: high_occupancy_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of occupancy values in a lane that exceeded the high value
          threshold detector diagnostic parameter for a station.
      - name: speed
        description: |
          Speed in the lane as measured by the detector in miles/hour.
          Weighted by count of samples in each period.
