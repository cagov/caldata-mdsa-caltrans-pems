          The Travel Time Index (TTI) is the ratio of the average travel time for all users
          across a region to the free-flow travel time. The free-flow travel time is taken
          to be the time to traverse the link when traveling at 60MPH. For loop-based
          performance measures, the TTI is simply the free-flow speed divided by the
          performance measure Q.
