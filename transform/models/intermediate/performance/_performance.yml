    description: |
      This file contains performance metrics by station and lane based on data from
      the station_meta and five_minute_agg models. This data forms the basis for
      performance metrics that will be aggregated over various spatial/temporal
      segments/timeframes
    columns:
      - name: sample_date
        description: The date associated with five minute aggregated data samples.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: id
        description: |
          An integer value that uniquely indentifies a station.
          Use this value to 'join' other files or tables that contain the Station ID value.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: lane
        description: Lane associated with a route and station from raw data
      - name: sample_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume (flow) and occupancy
          values contain any non-null value
      - name: volume_sum
        description: The sum of the flow values for a detector over the sample period.

        description: The average of the occupancy values over the sample period.
      - name: speed_five_mins
        description: |
          Actual reported speed if available otherwise the preliminary speed calculation
          in miles/hour based on the simplified version of the speed formula located at
          https://pems.dot.ca.gov/Papers/vanzwet_gfactor.pdf
      - name: vmt
        description: |
          The sum of the miles of freeway driven by each vehicle for a given unit of
          time and a given section of the freeway
      - name: vht
        description: |
          Vehicle Hours Travelled (VHT) is calculated over a given unit of time and a
          given section of freeway. VHT is the amount of time spent by all of the
          vehicles on the freeway.
      - name: q-value
        description: |
          Q is the sum of the VMT in a spatial and temporal region divided by the sum of
          the VHT in the same region. For a single location its interpretation is the
          average speed.
      - name: tti
        description: |
          The Travel Time Index (TTI) is the ratio of the average travel time for all users
          across a region to the free-flow travel time. The free-flow travel time is taken
          to be the time to traverse the link when traveling at 60MPH. For loop-based
          performance measures, the TTI is simply the free-flow speed divided by the
          performance measure Q.
      - name: delay
        description: |
          The Delay performance metric is the amount of additional time spent by the
          vehicles on a section of road due to congestion. This is the difference
          between the travel time at a non-congestion speed and the current speed.
          The congestion, or threshold, speed is usually 35MPH but in PeMS we compute
          the delay for a number of different thresholds so that we can accommodate
          different definitions of delay. The threshold values used are 35, 40, 45, 50,
          55, and 60 MPH. The formula is: F * (L/V - L/V_t). The formula is:
          F * (L/V - L/V_t). F = flow (volume), L = length of the segment, V = current speed,
          and V_t = threshold speed. Delay can never be negative.
      - name: lost_productivity
        description: |
          The Productivity perfromance metric is the number of lane-mile-hours on the freeway
          lost due to operating under congested conditions instead of under free-flow
          conditions. When the freeway is in congestion - which we take to be when the speed
          is below a certain, user-selectable, threshold - we find the ratio between the
          measured flow and the capacity for this location. This drop in capacity is due to
          the fact that the freeway is operating in congested conditions instead of in free-flow.
          We then multiply one minus this ratio by the length of the segment to determine the
          number of equivalent lane-miles-hours of freeway which this represents. For the
          capacity we look at the historical measured data for each location and determine the
          maximum observed 15-minute flow. We use the maximum of this value and 2076 v/l/h
          as the capacity at each location. The threshold values used are 35, 40, 45, 50, 55,
          and 60 MPH.
