    description: |
      This file contains performance metrics by station and lane based on data from
      the station_meta and five_minute_agg models. This data forms the basis for
      performance metrics that will be aggregated over various spatial/temporal
      segments/timeframes
    columns:
      - name: sample_date
        description: The date associated with five minute aggregated data samples.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: id
        description: |
          An integer value that uniquely indentifies a station.
          Use this value to 'join' other files or tables that contain the Station ID value.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: lane
        description: Lane associated with a route and station from raw data
      - name: sample_ct
        description: |
          Counts the number of raw data samples where a lane's volume (flow) and occupancy
          values contain any non-null value
      - name: volume
        description: The sum of the flow values for a detector over the sample period.
      - name: occupancy
        description: The average of the occupancy values over the sample period.
      - name: speed
        description: |
          Preliminary speed calculation in miles/hour based on the simplified version
          of the speed formula located at
          https://pems.dot.ca.gov/Papers/vanzwet_gfactor.pdf
      - name: vmt
        description: |
          The sum of the miles of freeway driven by each vehicle for a given unit of
          time and a given section of the freeway
      - name: vht
        description: |
          Vehicle Hours Travelled (VHT) is calculated over a given unit of time and a
          given section of freeway. VHT is the amount of time spent by all of the
          vehicles on the freeway.
      - name: q-value
        description: |
          Q is the sum of the VMT in a spatial and temporal region divided by the sum of
          the VHT in the same region. For a single location its interpretation is the
          average speed.
      - name: tti
        description: |
          The Travel Time Index (TTI) is the ratio of the average travel time for all users
          across a region to the free-flow travel time. The free-flow travel time is taken
          to be the time to traverse the link when traveling at 60MPH. For loop-based
          performance measures, the TTI is simply the free-flow speed divided by the
          performance measure Q.
