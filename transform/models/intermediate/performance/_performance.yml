      - name: tti
        description: |
          The Travel Time Index (TTI) is the ratio of the average travel time for all users
          across a region to the free-flow travel time. The free-flow travel time is taken
          to be the time to traverse the link when traveling at 60MPH. For loop-based
          performance measures, the TTI is simply the free-flow speed divided by the
          performance measure Q.
      - name: delay
        description: |
          The Delay performance metric is the amount of additional time spent by the
          vehicles on a section of road due to congestion. This is the difference
          between the travel time at a non-congestion speed and the current speed.
          The congestion, or threshold, speed is usually 35MPH but in PeMS we compute
          the delay for a number of different thresholds so that we can accommodate
          different definitions of delay. The threshold values used are 35, 40, 45, 50,
          55, and 60 MPH. The formula is: F * (L/V - L/V_t). The formula is:
          F * (L/V - L/V_t). F = flow (volume), L = length of the segment, V = current speed,
          and V_t = threshold speed. Delay can never be negative.
      - name: lost_productivity
        description: |
          The Productivity perfromance metric is the number of lane-mile-hours on the freeway
          lost due to operating under congested conditions instead of under free-flow
          conditions. When the freeway is in congestion - which we take to be when the speed
          is below a certain, user-selectable, threshold - we find the ratio between the
          measured flow and the capacity for this location. This drop in capacity is due to
          the fact that the freeway is operating in congested conditions instead of in free-flow.
          We then multiply one minus this ratio by the length of the segment to determine the
          number of equivalent lane-miles-hours of freeway which this represents. For the
          capacity we look at the historical measured data for each location and determine the
          maximum observed 15-minute flow. We use the maximum of this value and 2076 v/l/h
          as the capacity at each location. The threshold values used are 35, 40, 45, 50, 55,
          and 60 MPH.

        description: |
          This procedure begins by calculating Monthly Average Days of the Week (MADW) values,
          which are the average daily flows for each day of the week and each month of the
          year (a total of 84 values). From these, 12 Monthly Average Daily Traffic (MADT)
          values are calculated as the average of the non-missing MADW values for each month.
          Finally, AADT_2 is computed as the average of all MADT values. This algorithm allows
          one or more of the 7 weekday values to be missing for the MADT computation,
          but none of the 12 MADT values may be missing for the final average. This is known as
          ASTM Standard 1442.

          the week as the average across all 12 months. Finally, AADT_3 is computed as the average
          of these 7 AADW values.Missing data are not imputed; therefore, incomplete days are not
          used in the calculation of MADW values.This is known as Conventional AASHTO Procedures.

          and day of the week, the 24 MAHW values are summed to produce a MADW value. Then, just as in
          AADT_3, 7 AADW values are produced as the averages of MADW across 12 months, which are then
          averaged to yield AADT_4.This method is known as Provisional AASHTO Procedures.

      The PeMS system runs a bottleneck identification algorithm every day. The original algorithm was
      presented in, "Systematic Identification of Freeway Bottlenecks," by Chen, C., Skabardonis, A.,
      Varaiya, P. (2003). Transportation Research Board, 2004.

      This model identifies bottlenecks at every station. A bottleneck is defined by the following
      conditions:
         1. There is a drop in speed of at least 20 mph between stations during the same time
         2. The speed at the current station (upstream station) is less than 40 mph.
         3. The stations are less than 3 miles apart.
         4. The speed drop persists for at least 5 out of any 7 contiguous 5-minute data points.

      If all of these conditions are met then we declare that there is a bottleneck at this location
      that has been activated for all of the seven 5-minute time points.

      We perform this analysis for each of three time periods:
        - AM shift (5am - 10am)
        - Noon shift (10am - 3pm)
        - PM shift (3pm - 8pm)

      For each location where a bottleneck is activated we compute the following:
         1. **Duration** - This is how long the bottleneck was active during that particular shift on
         that day.
         2. **Spatial Extent** - For each 5-minute period when the bottleneck was active we see how
         far upstream the bottleneck extends.For this, at each time point, we find the farthest
         upstream detector with speed less than 40 mph and use that location as the extent during
         that 5-minute period. To get a single extent for the entire bottleneck, we take the
         median of the extents for each 5-minute period.
         3. **Delay** - The delay is simply the sum of the individual PeMS segment delays for the
         entire duration and spatial extent of the bottleneck. The delay is calculated with
         respect to a threshold speed of 60 mph.
