-- # of samples < 60% of the max collected samples during the test period.
-- max value is a static value, which should be two samples per minute times 60 mins/hr times 17 hours in a day 
-- (1224 is the static number of samples) - 
-- this max value doesnt need to be calculated at the station_id level bc it's the same
-- btwn 1 and 1224 is too few samples.
