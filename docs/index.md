# Traffic Operations PeMS Modernization Project

This website contains the technical documentation for Traffic Operations's PeMS Modernization project.

## Background

The Performance Measurement System (PeMS) is a mission critical data collection, reporting and analysis product managed
by Caltrans Traffic Operations staff. PeMS is also a public facing website, serving worldwide users.
Caltrans PeMS is a software tool designed specifically for Caltrans. It is the centralized repository for all of Caltransâ€™
real-time traffic data, enabling access to these data that might otherwise be dispersed across multiple districts and more
difficult to obtain. PeMS provides a consolidated database of traffic data collected by Caltrans placed on state highways
throughout California, as well as other Caltrans and partner agency data sets. The data collected by vehicle detectors are
relayed from the field to Caltrans Transportation Management Centers (TMCs) and then sent to PeMS. In more technical terms,
PeMS is a real-time Archive Data Management System (rt-ADMS) that collects, stores, and processes raw data in real-time.
PeMS can be accessed via a standard Internet browser and contains a series of built-in analytical capabilities to support a
variety of uses.

Due to the current outdated technology stack being used, PeMS has been ranked high as a cyber security risk for Caltrans.
The current version of PeMS also contains the following issues:

1. High maintenance costs
2. Service interruptions
3. Utilizes a sole source contractor
4. Limited access to algorithm's being used in calcuations/analysis
5. Data loss
6. Slow user experience

In 2023, Caltrans was awarded with the Modern Data Tech Stack Program by the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI). At no cost to
Caltrans, the Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) uses its own budget and staff to develop and deploy the modernized PeMS System.
ODI will also train Caltrans Traffic Ops and IT staff to sustainably maintain and further improve the new version of PeMS. The
Traffic Operations team is currently pursuing the next phase of the PeMS Modernization Project with ODI, which will feature
Modernized PeMS data processing pipeline with Machine Learning model.
